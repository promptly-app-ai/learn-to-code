# **PART 2 — Your First Hour (Do This First)**

*A step-by-step experience to get your first real “I’m coding!” win*

# ---------------------------------------------------------

Everything below is **exact, copy/paste friendly**, and designed to build confidence immediately.

You will:

1. Open a **simple online coding playground**
2. Paste your first JavaScript program
3. Run it
4. Tweak it
5. Break it (on purpose)
6. Learn how to ask AI for *teaching*, not *fixing*
7. (Optional) See a step-by-step animation of code running
8. (Optional) Try the same idea in Python

By the end of this hour, you’ll understand:

* what a program *is*
* how to run code
* how to change things and see results
* how to ask questions effectively
* how to learn through exploration

No setup. No friction. No overwhelm.

---

# **Step 1 — Open the REPL (PlayCode)**

A **REPL** is just a place where you can write code and immediately run it.

Open this link:

➡️ **[https://playcode.io/new](https://playcode.io/new)**

You will see:

* a white area where code goes
* a Run ▶️ button
* an Output panel where results appear

If anything pops up asking about an account, just close it — no login is needed.

---

# **Step 2 — Paste your first JavaScript program**

Delete whatever text is in the code window and paste this:

```javascript
console.log("Hello! You just ran your first program.");
```

Now click **Run ▶️**.

You should see:

```
Hello! You just ran your first program.
```

Congratulations — this is your first coding win.

**Small win #1: You wrote code and the computer responded.**

---

# **Step 3 — Tweak it**

Change the message:

```javascript
console.log("I changed the message!");
```

Click **Run ▶️** again.

You just modified your first program.

**Small win #2: You changed code and saw the result immediately.**

---

# **Step 4 — Add another line**

Type this below your first line:

```javascript
console.log("This is my second line.");
```

Run it.

You should now see two lines in the output.

**Small win #3: You expanded your program.**

---

# **Step 5 — Break it on purpose (this is important)**

Delete one quotation mark so it looks like this:

```javascript
console.log("This will break);
```

Run it.

You should now see an **error message** in the Output panel.

This is **normal**. This is **good**.
Errors are part of coding, not a sign you’re bad at it.

**Small win #4: You saw what happens when code is malformed.**

---

# **Step 6 — Learn how to use AI as a teacher (not a fixer)**

Instead of “fixing the code,” ask AI to **explain the error**.

Copy the exact error message from PlayCode and paste it into ChatGPT using a prompt like:

> **“Can you explain this error in simple terms and show me what the correct code should look like? Please also tell me what kinds of mistakes usually cause this error.”**

This builds two critical instincts:

* Ask AI to **teach you**, not just fix things
* Understand *why* your code behaved a certain way
* Learn the “shape” of common mistakes

You are building debugging intuition — the heart of programming.

---

# **Step 7 — (Optional) See your code run visually**

If you want to see what the computer is *actually doing*, step-by-step:

Go to:
➡️ **[https://pythontutor.com/javascript.html](https://pythontutor.com/javascript.html)**

Then:

1. Paste your working code (not the broken one)
2. Click **Visualize Execution**

You’ll see an animation of the program running, one line at a time.

This tool is amazing for beginners — it turns invisible computer behavior into something you can *see*.

---

# **Step 8 — (Optional) Try the same idea in Python**

If you want to see how a different language looks:

Open the Python sandbox:
➡️ **[https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/)**

Paste this:

```python
print("Hello from Python!")
```

Run it.

Then change the message and run again.

You’ll notice:

* same idea
* different syntax
* similar behavior

Seeing parallels helps you understand *concepts*, not just memorized patterns.

---

# **Step 9 — A small moment of reflection**

If you’ve made it here, notice how much you just learned in a short time:

* you ran real code
* you edited it
* you caused an error
* you learned to interpret the error
* you learned how to ask AI the right question
* you saw a visual execution
* you compared two languages

These early steps matter far more than memorizing vocabulary.
This is the beginning of real comprehension.

And importantly:

✨ **You are already coding.** ✨
