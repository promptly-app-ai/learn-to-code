# **PART 3 — Quick Orientation: How Code Works**

*A super simple, zero-jargon overview before you explore further*

# ---------------------------------------------------------

This part is intentionally short. It gives just enough clarity so later concepts feel less mysterious — but it will not drown you in theory.

Think of it like a mental map of what’s happening when you run code.

---

# **1. What is “code,” really?**

Code is a set of instructions you give to a computer.

That’s it.

You write something → the computer reads it → the computer does something.

In JavaScript:

```javascript
console.log("Hi!");
```

You told the computer:

> “Print the text Hi! on the screen.”

In Python:

```python
print("Hi!")
```

Same idea, different flavor.

---

# **2. What happens when code runs?**

A computer processes your program one step at a time, from top to bottom.

A simple mental model:

```
Your code
   ↓
Computer reads it
   ↓
Computer follows the instructions
   ↓
You see output or effects
```

That’s really all you need to understand at this stage.

---

# **3. Why are there different programming languages?**

Different languages are built for different purposes, like tools in a toolbox:

* **JavaScript** → runs in every web browser
* **Python** → great for learning, data, science tools
* **Swift** → iPhone apps
* **Kotlin** → Android apps
* **SQL** → talking to databases
* **C++** → games + performance-heavy tasks

But here’s the important part:

> Once you understand concepts (variables, loops, functions), learning new languages becomes way easier.

Same concepts, different syntax.

---

# **4. What is a program made of? (the ingredients)**

Every program in every language is built from the same basic building blocks:

* **Data** (things the program remembers—stored in variables)
* **Logic** (decisions and steps—if/else, loops, functions)
* **Output** (results the program shows you)

As you learn, these will feel natural.

---

# **5. Where does code run? (execution environments)**

At a simple level, code can run in three places:

```
[ Browser ] → JavaScript runs here (websites, interactive pages)
[ Server  ] → Backend code (databases, APIs)
[ Device  ] → Phone apps (Swift, Kotlin)
```

**For this guide:**
We’ll focus on **browser JavaScript**, because it gives instant results with no setup.

Python examples appear occasionally for comparison.

---

# **6. What is a REPL?**

A **REPL** (like PlayCode) is simply:

```
Type code → Run → See result → Edit → Run again
```

It stands for:

* **R**ead (your code)
* **E**valuate (execute it)
* **P**rint (output)
* **L**oop (repeat)

You don’t need to remember the acronym — just the idea.

---

# **7. What is an error?**

Errors are just the computer saying:

> “This doesn’t make sense to me. Please check your syntax or your logic.”

Errors are not failures.
Errors are feedback.
Errors are normal.

Everyone gets them.
You will too, and it doesn’t mean you're doing anything wrong.

---

# **8. A little secret: no one memorizes everything**

Professional programmers Google things constantly.
They forget syntax.
They check examples.
They use AI for explanations.

Programming is not about memorizing.
It’s about:

* recognizing patterns
* understanding concepts
* knowing how to explore
* solving problems step-by-step

You already started doing that.
