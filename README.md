# **THE BEGINNER’S CHOOSE-YOUR-OWN-ADVENTURE GUIDE TO CODING**

*A friendly, visual, ADHD-safe starting point for learning to code today*

# ---------------------------------------------------------

---

# **PART 1 — Welcome & How to Use This Guide**

## **Why this guide exists**

Learning to code is exciting, but the early stage often feels overwhelming. There are:

* too many tools
* too many tutorials
* too many “start here” opinions
* too much jargon
* too much pressure to “follow a course” from start to finish

This guide avoids all of that.

Instead, it gives you:

* **an instant win in the first few minutes**
* **small, friendly explanations**
* **visual resources**
* **places to explore at your own pace**
* **instructions for using AI as a teacher, not a crutch**
* **the option to skim and jump around without getting lost**

You don’t need to understand everything at once.
You don’t need to learn in order.
You don’t need to “finish” this guide.

If something sparks curiosity, that’s your next step.
That’s the entire philosophy.

## **How this guide is structured**

This is not a syllabus. It’s a map.

You’ll find:

* **The First Hour** → your first real hands-on experience
* **Curiosity Modules** → short, visual, playful learning paths
* **Core Concepts** → the building blocks of how code works
* **Tools** → simple, modern ways to run code
* **AI Skills** → how to ask for help without becoming dependent on AI
* **Beginner AI Concepts** → how tools like ChatGPT work
* **Next Steps** → what to explore later if you want more

Feel free to skip, skim, and bounce around.

## **What you need before starting**

Only two things:

1. A web browser
2. Curiosity

You do **not** need:

* to install anything
* to buy anything
* to know math
* to sign into accounts
* to set up “projects”
* to create folders
* to understand what a “framework” is

If you can copy, paste, and click "Run," you can start coding.

---

## **Which languages we use in this guide**

You’ll learn using:

### **JavaScript (main language in this guide)**

Because:

* it runs in every browser
* it’s perfect for instant results
* no installation is needed
* you can see things happen visually (text → colors → animations)

### **Python (optional side-by-side examples)**

Because:

* it’s extremely beginner-friendly
* the syntax is clean
* many people eventually learn it for data projects

You do **not** need to pick a favorite yet.
Just follow the examples and notice the common patterns.

---

## **One small motivational note**

Confusion in the beginning is normal.
Everyone who has ever coded has felt:

* lost
* unsure
* overwhelmed
* stuck

That feeling is a sign your brain is learning something new.

You’ll get quick wins soon — and they add up fast.
